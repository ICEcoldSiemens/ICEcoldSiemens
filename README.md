# ‚ú®Welcome to my mark, my name is Somto Ezeoke üëã


# Introduction 
I am an undergraduate student within the University of Gloucestershire studying a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. A young individual programmer interested in software development and machine learning, utilizing Java and many more programming languages to come, aspiring to become a prolific Java Programmer and AI Engineer with the abilities to develop high quality scalable applications while integrating Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to automate processes. My experience with programming spans from multiple projects, incorporating data structures and algorithms, object-oriented and functional programming, user interface development, web frameworks and database access. These projects encourage me to update my technical skillset and break out of my comfort zone, applying myself to configure successful programs with efficient techniques, taking pride in my creations or contributions. Apart from software development, my hobbies include playing football‚öΩ on the field and chess‚ôü on the board. Maybe one day, we could play one of these games together and talk üòâ

# Experiences & Projects 
IEUK 2025 Virtual Internship (Bright Network) -> Tasked with constructing a 200 word report and develop a network traffic log analyser program based on the scenario of a startup music streaming website's performance gradually reducing as servers become overwhelmed with unexpected spikes of network traffic. Applied problem solving with intuition to generate and specifiy potential problems with soluions on the traffic log, documenting relevant information and recommendations, revealing suspicious bot activity leading to a denial of service attack.

<br><br>
üéµ CLI Music Player -> My first personal program called "VIBES", implementing Java, basic programming techniques, data structures, OOP and multithreading principles to provide music features during song, automatic music playing, etc.
<br><br>
üèì Graphical User Interface Pong Game -> A university assignment for a module focused on object-oriented programming. Demonstrated my ability to implement OOP principles effectively for code readability, security and maintainablity. Java SWING was utilized as the UI framework. Such features included entity abstraction, decomposing unwanted bugs and potential problems to achieve desired outcomes. 
<br><br>
‚úàÔ∏è CLI Flight Scheduling Application -> Another university assignment for a module focused on data structures and algorithms. Successfully utlized multiple data structures such as arraylists and queues combined with efficient algorithms like Binary Search to scheduling logic with users.

All projects are constantly going through improvement as I broaden my technical knowledge.

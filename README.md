# ✨Welcome to my GitHub, my name is Somto Ezeoke 👋


# Introduction 
I am a final year undergraduate student studying for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science within the University of Gloucestershire. An experienced Java programmer interested in software development and machine learning, utilizing Java and many more programming languages to build enterprise-level applications. Currently working on constructing and improving high-performing ML models and previous projects, incorporating better technical features and techniques for efficiency. These projects encourage me to be creative and break out of my comfort zone, applying effort and resilence to successfully configure. I take pride in my creations or contributions. Apart from software development, my hobbies include playing football on the field and chess on the board. Feel free to communicate below. <br><br>

# Experiences & Projects 
IEUK 2025 Virtual Internship (Bright Network) -> Tasked with constructing a 200 word report and develop a network traffic log analyser program based on the scenario of a startup music streaming website's performance gradually reducing as servers become overwhelmed with unexpected spikes of network traffic. Applied problem solving with intuition to generate and specifiy potential problems with soluions on the traffic log, documenting relevant information and recommendations, revealing suspicious bot activity leading to a denial of service attack.

<br><br>
🏓 Graphical User Interface Pong Game -> A university assignment for a module focused on object-oriented programming. Demonstrated my ability to implement OOP principles effectively for code readability, security and maintainablity. Java SWING was utilized as the UI framework. Such features included entity abstraction, decomposing unwanted bugs and potential problems to achieve desired outcomes. 
<br><br>
✈️ CLI Flight Scheduling Application -> Another university assignment for a module focused on data structures and algorithms. Successfully utlized multiple data structures such as arraylists and queues combined with efficient algorithms like Binary Search to scheduling logic with users.

All projects are constantly going through improvement as I broaden my technical knowledge. <br><br>
